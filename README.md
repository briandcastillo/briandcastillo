- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Brian Castillo!
- I recently graduated from UC Irvine with my bachelors in physics and was a former researcher in neutrino physics.
- As a former researcher in the field of neutrino physics, I bring a strong analytical background to my new venture into the world of data analysis. My experience in scientific research has equipped me
with skills in data cleaning, implementation of data cuts, data visualization, and complex modeling. Now, I'm channeling these skills to tackle real-world business challenges, leveraging data to drive insights and inform decision-making.
